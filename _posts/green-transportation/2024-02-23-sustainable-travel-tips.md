Sustainable travel is an active commitment towards minimizing the environmental impact that our journeys carry. It's an ethic that extends beyond just reducing our carbon footprints and encompasses all aspects of our travel, from the accommodations we choose to our interactions with local communities.

When we think of sustainable travel, our first thought may gravitate towards eco-friendly lodging. But what does that look like? Travellers can opt for accommodations that go the extra mile to protect the environment. These hotels implement [energy-saving measures](https://www.hotelengine.com/blog/business-travel-guide/corporate-travel-eco-friendly-hotels/), conserve water, and devise strategies to reduce waste. Some examples include properties that are equipped with solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems and recycling programs. 

However, sustainable travel doesn't stop at just choosing eco-friendly accommodations. A significant aspect of it involves supporting local businesses and economies. This can be done through making mindful choices to stay at homestays, eco-friendly homes, and local B&Bs. It not only reduces the environmental impact but has a significant socio-economic benefit for the communities in the destination.

Another crucial aspect of sustainable travel pertains to our choices in transport. Using public transportation not only lowers carbon emissions significantly, but also offers travelers an opportunity to experience the local lifestyle. Bikes, trams, buses and trains are popular modes of transport that are environmentally friendly and helps one connect with the destination in a profoundly immersive way. 

Engagement in [community-based activities](https://frontenacarchbiosphere.ca/eco-friendly-travel-tips/) constitute yet another important element of sustainable travel.
